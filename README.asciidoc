Paraminator GUI
===============

About
-----
Paraminator GUI is a graphical front-end to ReplicatorG's paraminator
script used to generate Skeinforge test files.

Requirements
------------
Paraminator GUI requires Python and PyGTK. It's been tested with Python 2.7
and PyGTK 2.22.

I had to change a couple of paths in the paraminator script to make it work.
Included is the patch with the changes I had to make.

Usage
-----
Due to paraminator's limitations, Paraminator GUI has to be run from the same
directory paraminator lives in. To launch, run

----
python paraminatorgui.py
----

After running for the first time, the program will generate an .ini file 
with its configuration settings. If you want to change the path to your Python
interpreter, you'd have to edit this file manually. Other settings can be
modified from the program itself.
